            Luis von Ahn a Guatemalan entrepreneur with great abilities in computer science, created reCAPTCHA in 2007, most of you know it so I'll just say it's a <em>system designed to establish that a computer user is human</em>. The tool was <b>so useful</b> it was acquired just two years later by Google in 2009 for more than 30 million ($30000000). It became Luis a millionare but he kept working as a teacher, he kept learning and building software for the people.<br><br>
            That's how in 2011 he created Duolingo with Severin Hacker, a Swiss, PhD student of Von Ahn's at the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science. Since Duolingo was born Von Ahn wanted the app to be free forever, stating that the majority of people who are trying to learn a language do so to improve their socio-economic prospects, and can't accord the $300-500 price tags on popular, Rosetta Stone software.<br><br>
             Von Ahn also wanted to create another program that served two purposes in one (like reCAPTCHA did), Duolingo does this by teaching its users a foreign language while having them translate simple phrases in documents. Under the motto "free education will really change the world and we want to supply the people an outlet to do so". the company grew very fast. Today the app offer 68 different language courses across 23 languages, with 22 additional courses in development, they have about 150 million registered users across the world. Duolingo had been valued at USD $470 million in 2015.<br><br>
